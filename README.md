## MVP Studio Code

These are some of the preparation tasks I had completed at MVP Studio before I moved onto the core team.

### Onboarding task

A set of basic SQL tasks to show competency.

### Competition task

The competition tasks involved a full workflow, from data standardisation to dashboarding. 

Included here is the snowflake data warehouse design done in SQL.

### Advanced task

A much larger and more involved full workflow, completed as part of a team. I worked on the crime data standardisation, which proved to be a large task. 

The R code is presented here. The input data was transformed using excel before being input to R. However, the NSW data was too large to be pivoted in Excel so it was done in R.
